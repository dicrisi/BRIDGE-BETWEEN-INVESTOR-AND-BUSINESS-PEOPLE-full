<h1>About</h1>
<p align="Justify">
Investment in India is a concept based on business purpose. In this project I will be providing   platform to the investors and also connecting the people with good business concepts. This in turn will evolve how much to invest and where to invest the money with good returns on investment. 
Here providing two forms - one for investors and another one for business people with contact details. There are situation when the people have excess funds they will try to park this amount in Banks or Gold.  Here, I am exploring the possibility of investing these excess funds directly to the business connecting the investor and the business persons.
 I am developing the application which will connect the investor and the business people and vice-versa.  I will be charging for usage of my application from both the ends.
The need for developing this project was to bridge the huge communicational gap between the business people and investors and also with no time to contact each other on the common platform. 
To overcome these disadvantages, I am developing this platform, like private based marketing network for creating a venture based organization. I will get the investors at one place and they can share their investment plans with each other and contact to the business people.
